* Abstract: <Br>
  With the sudden closure of Tech Shop, it has become harder for people to build their
  own stuff in the south bay area.  My talk will cover the strategies for getting your
  stuff built.  This talk will focus primarily on electronic and mechanical construction
  issues.  This will probably be a pretty interactive presentation.
